		<p>In my junior year of college, I landed my first internship in New York City at Boglioli. While interning at Boglioli, I assisted market appointments for both men's and women's collections, helped the wholesales process from writing orders to shipping and logistics, supported external PR teams with products needed from the showroom. From this experience, I learned how to work well independently and with a team-, communicate effectively, efficiently coordinate tasks, and work under pressure.

		<p>With my background in Korean military service, I am good at harmonizing with other members. Also, this experience has developed my flexibility and an ability to assimilate easily in new environments.
